      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The website will be a demo website that will show the proposed redesign page for <a href="https://central.cards/" target="_blank">central.cards</a> website, 
        this is a website that my friend bought and we want to make it looks better. To make this possible, 
        instead of using the actual API and image URL, I could download the images that I need to use. 
        The webpage will then be used as a demo to show what changes I want to offer on the actual website site. 
        JS will not be included, just the HMTL structure and css.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The main audience for this is my friend, the owner of <a href="https://central.cards/" target="_blank">central.cards</a> 
        and those that I will asked for suggestions.

        Central.Cards â€“ Buy and Rent Splinterlands Cards<br><br>
        <b>Our goal</b><br>
        Central.Cards is a Splinterlands marketplace that specializes in automatically buying and renting cards. <br>
        Users will be able to buy/rent a desired amount of power or specific lineups while not exceeding their specified budget.<br>
        A classic buy/rent page where users can pick cards will also be available soon.<br><br>

        <b>About Splinterlands</b><br>
        Started in mid 2018, Splinterlands is the original NFT trading card game.<br>

        Splinterlands is a unique digital trading card game that allows players to truly own their cards and other in-game assets.
        Thanks to web 3.0 technology powered by the HIVE blockchain, each card in Splinterlands is a non-fungible token (NFT) owned by a player.
        That means players can do anything they want with their cards, including battling for rewards, holding them as collectibles, trading on the peer-to-peer market,
        combining to level up, or even burning to obtain Dark Energy Crystals (DEC), which is the official in-game cryptocurrency of Splinterlands.<br>
        The game was founded by blockchain innovators who shared a mutual frustration with mainstream digital trading card games that stemmed from
        players losing ownership of their assets when trading card games went digital. The companies who actually own the cards that players are
        supposed to "own" themselves can withhold information, reprint cards as often as they'd like, or even wholly delete a player's collection
        based on inactivity or a violation of terms. Through the power of blockchain, Splinterlands solves these problems by making digital trading
        cards transparent, scarce, and actually owned by the players who own them.<br>

        With hundreds of unique cards, Splinterlands is a brilliantly designed and fast-paced trading card game that allows its players to earn by
        playing (P2E). Unlike more traditional TCGs like Magic: The Gathering, and Pokemon, Splinterlands battles are fast, with each match taking
        only 2-3 minutes. Rather than turn-based action in which every move is carefully and slowly controlled, Splinterlands' main mechanic is a
        drafting style. Once an opponent is found, each player assembles a team of up to 6 cards from their Splinterlands collection. Then according 
        to a unique set of rules that make every match different, the battle is played out automatically in a quick, action-packed format that allows 
        players to learn from both victory and defeat.<br>

        Splinterlands is a strategist's dream, beloved by one of the largest and most loyal followings in the play-to-earn industry. 
        It is translated into nearly a dozen languages and played in over 100 countries worldwide. Each day, thousands of cards are traded for 
        thousands of dollars on the peer 2 peer monster market. Join the fight at Splinterlands.com<br>
