    <p>
        Hi everyone, my name is Dhener but you could call me Dee. <br>
        Iam currently studying BS Applied Technology while working fulltime as Senior Vetting Analyst.<br>
        I am also now working on my second certificate.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I am married now for eight years, and have one children, we waited for six years before we got a child but the wait is all worth it.<br>
        Other than playing games, my hobby now and coding or programming, I am currently working on two projects while working fulltime.<br>
        Though I kindda have advance knowledge now in front-end programming, I am not really good with designs.<br>
        I am looking forward to work with you in this semester.
    </p>
